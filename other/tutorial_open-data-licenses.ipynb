    "The main difference between open data licenes and free or open source software licenses, lies in the definition of the obligations that must be met in order to obtain the rights. There are already lists of open source licenses that guarantee the four freedoms.

    "* Non-commercial (NC) <br>\n",
    "You may not use the material for commercial purposes. As there is no definition of what is considered commercial, and an NGO or a nonprofit organization may also be considered commercial entities, this clause renders data licensed under it not open. \n",

    "Public domain is a concept in which no copyright or other protection like patents and trademark exists and thus no obligations are defined. In order to label and communicate this, a public domain license is useful! In some countries, like Germany, it is not possible to waive one's copyright. Specifically declaring a public domain license will ensure a legal status that is equivalent to public domain. <br>\n",
