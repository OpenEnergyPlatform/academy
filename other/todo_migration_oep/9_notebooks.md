# Jupyter Notebooks - What they are and how to use them

Some of the tutorials in the OEP use jupyter notebooks. These are collected and updated in the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/tutorial). Jupyter notebooks essentially offer a user-friendly interface to run python code step by step. Unfortunately we cannot allow users to run arbitrary code on this website, so you'll have to download and run the code locally. A general description on how to work with jupyter notebooks is provided by Michael Fudge in the youtube-video below.
