        "OpenenEnergyMetadata(OEM) is a standardised metadata format. OEM are used to provide relevant information about a dataset on the OEP \"It´s data explaining the data :)\". OEM are mandatory for oficially publishing data on the OEP, because this will clarify any licensing issues in advance and also provide context for the review that is part of every publishing process. You can find out how to publish your data in the [publishing guidebook](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/tutorials/99_other/OEP_Research_Data_Publishing_Guidebook/). There are descriptions on how to upload OEM on the Open Energy Platform itself with a [wizard](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/tutorials/99_other/wizard/#upload-a-csv-file-using-the-wizard) and a more [technical description](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/tutorials/02_oep_client/02_client_python_upload/)) for using the API in scrips. If a dataset has already been uploaded to the OEP, then the metadata can be seen in the [view of the table](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/view/climate/szenariendb_gwp) by clicking on the tab `Meta Information` right next to `Data`. The OEP also offers functions for editing and downloading metadata, which can be accessed in the Meta Information view . Make sure to [sign in](https://openenergyplatform.org/user/login/?next=/) to the OEP in advance to be able to edit the data. You can see what permissions you have in the options on the rigth hand side by clicking on [Permissions](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/view/climate/szenariendb_gwp/permissions).\n",

        "OEMetadata development is partially based on the specification of [frictionless data](https://frictionlessdata.io/). The advantage is that OEM is compatible with [frictionless datapackage format](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#language) and thus a solid basis for applicability is ensured. In the easiest case, a frictionless datapackage is a JSON-file that is placed directly next to the actual data - the former describing the latter.\n",

        "There are several ways to create the OEMetadata. One way is to download the [template JSON file](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/metadata/latest/template.json) and fill it manually in your text editor of choice. Another option is to use a tool on the OEP website called [wizard](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/wizard/). There, a table can be created, data can be uploaded from an excel or CSV file and the metadata can be filled in. The wizard is much more user friendly for beginners, so we recommend using the tool. Once the metadata has been created, in order to go into review it should be downloaded and put in an inssue on GitHub to start the review process. If you are unable to do this, create an issue and get in touch with a reviewer who will help you with those steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "The metadata can be filled in to the best of your knowledge in a first step. If there are any difficulties, it is sufficient to create an issue on GitHub to get in contact with the OEP developers. The [issue template](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/data-preprocessing/issues/new?assignees=christian-rli%2C+jh-RLI%2C+Ludee&labels=review&template=metadata-and-data-review.md&title=Review%3A+NameOfDataset) can be used for this purpose. Unfortunately at this stage of development a GitHub account is still required for this. "
