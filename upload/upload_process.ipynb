    "Metadata provides information about other data. By creating metadata for your dataset, you are making sure, that it is easier to find and to understand, it's supplied with its sources and its structure is well described. The OEP uses a [oemetadata](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata) as a standard, which was developed specifically for energy research modelling. It is based on json and compatible to the [datapackage standard](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#language). An example oemetadata file in the current version 1.4.0 is available [here](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/oemetadata/v140/example.json). \n",

    "Filling out your first string for the first time might take a while. Once you're familiar with what the different fields stand for, it'll become much faster. You can start with an empty [template string](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/oemetadata/v140/template.json) and just work your way from top to bottom. A key for what every field means is available [here](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/wiki/Metadata-Description). Important for the scientific process are the sources.\n",
