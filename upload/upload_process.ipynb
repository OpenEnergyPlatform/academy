By creating metadata for your dataset, you are making sure, that it is easier to find and to understand, it's supplied with its sources and its structure is well described. The OEP uses [oemetadata](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata) as a standard, which was developed specifically for energy research modelling. It is based on json and compatible to the [datapackage standard](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#language). An example oemetadata file in the current version 1.4.0 is available in the [oemetadata repository](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/oemetadata/v140/example.json). \n",

A [description for every key](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/wiki/Metadata-Description) of the string with example entries is available on its repository wiki page.\n",
