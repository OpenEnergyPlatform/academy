    "Metadata provide information about other data. By creating metadata for your dataset, you are making sure, that it is easier to find and to understand, it's supplied with its sources and its structure is well described. The OEP uses [oemetadata](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata) as a standard, which was developed specifically for energy research modelling. It is based on json and compatible to the [datapackage standard](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#language). An example oemetadata file in the current version 1.4.0 is available in the [oemetadata repository](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/oemetadata/v140/example.json). \n",

There is already a suite of small tools, mainly written in python, that aim to facilitate access. There is a hands on tutorial that will guide you through the process of uploading example data and metadata from files on your computer all the way into a publicly visible place on the OEP. The structure of the same tutorial is available as a template for you to fill in with your own data. These tutorials are going to use a range of tools. A brief description of these tools and how to set them up on your system will make up the rest of this guidebook."
