    "Metadata provide information about other data. By creating metadata for your dataset, you are making sure, that it is easier to find and to understand, it's supplied with its sources and its structure is well described. The OEP uses [oemetadata](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata) as a standard, which was developed specifically for energy research modelling. It is based on json and compatible to the [datapackage standard](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/#language). An example oemetadata file in the current version 1.4.0 is available in the [oemetadata repository](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/oemetadata/v140/example.json). \n",

You can start with an empty [template string](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/oemetadata/v140/template.json) and just work your way from top to bottom. A [description for every key](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/master/metadata/v140/metadata_key_description.md) of the string with example entries is available on the oemetadata repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take care when creating your resources that your data types correspond to [postgresql datatypes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html), because these definitions will be used when uploading your data. Most likely, you will mostly use these types:\n",
