# 05 - Ontology (legacy)

## Part 2 - General introduction on ontologies and the OEO -- Under construction!

### How can I contribute to the Open Energy Ontology?

Development of the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) is a community effort and
takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology).
In the following sections of this course we have bundled information on
how to get involved and how to contribute to the OEO.

You can provide feedback to this course on GitHub: [https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/academy/issues/167](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/academy/issues/167)

### For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, policy makers and any interested person, who**

- want to get an overview and a deeper understanding of the domain of energy system modelling and its underlying concepts,
- want to annotate their data with controlled terms, enhance its visibility and make it comparable and interoperable with existing data
- want to develop a powerful open-source tool to enhance data management in the energy domain under the FAIR principles.

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this module, you will know**

- what an ontology is and how the OEO works,
- what the benefits of contributing to the OEO are,
- what the different levels of contribution are and
- what steps you have to fulfill to add new terms and concepts to the OEO.

### Where can I get general information on ontologies and the OEO?

### Why should I contribute to the OEO?

:oep-icon-info: The OEO provides a controlled vocabulary for the domain of
energy system modelling and energy research. Within the
[Open Energy Family](https://openenergyplatform.org/about/)
the OEO links the
different family members by means of a machine readable and machine
actionable terminology. By this it ensures better comparability,
interoperability, and reusability of research data on the platform and
in the domain. By contributing to the OEO you can help building up a
powerful tool for data annotation and comparison within energy
research, make your data more visible and increase its impact in your
working field.

### How do I get started?

### What different ways of contributing to the OEO are there?

:oep-icon-info: Contribution to the OEO can take place on different levels: You
may only want to take part in discussions on topics you are interested
in. Or you may want to implement new concepts to the OEO. To switch from
discussing terms to implementing them and to get familiar with the
process it can be a good idea to start with reviewing pull requests.
