## Metadata Upload

The contributer (metadata owner) has to [upload the metadata](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/wizard/) to the [OpenEnergyPlatform](https://openenergyplatform.org/) (OEP). (If you are unsure how to do that, have a look at [this tutorial](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/tutorials/99_other/beginners_guide/#22-create-metadata).) It needs to be insured that the metadata includes a license and a possible embargo period of 6 months or 1 year. The metadata is automatically uploaded to [modal_draft](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/view/model_draft). (Note! The prerequisite for metadata is an existing table. You can't load anything without a table.) 


## Initiation of the Review Process

Once the metadata is publicly accessible in the [modal_draft](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/view/model_draft) section, anyone can start the review process by going to the 'Open Peer Review' View (next to 'Meta information') and clicking on 'Start Open Peer Review' at the end of the page.  (Note: The metadata owner cannot review their own metadata.)
The review process is exclusive; menanig once the review process has started, no one else can initiate the review process for the same metadata. (Note: After a review is finished a new review can be started.)

## Review Process

The reviewer who initiated the process must review all fields (except contributor and resources metadatafields or empty fields) with the options to accept the field, suggest a change, or reject it and provide an alternative. Then follows the transimission of the review from the reviewer back to the contributer. (Mote: The reviewer can only forward the review to the contributor once they has evaluated all non-empty fields (accepted, suggested, rejected).)

## Handling Review Suggestions

If the reviewer has suggestions for certain fields, these are sent to the contributor. In the contributor's profile, under the Peer Review section, the review with the reviewer’s suggestions can be seen. The contributor can then accept or reject the reviewer’s suggestions, proposing alternatives if necessary. After the contributor has accepted/rejected all suggested fields, they send it back to the reviewer for verification. This process continues until all fields are mutually accepted. 

## Completion of the Review Process

When the reviewer agrees with all fields during the review process, after accepting all fields, they can choose a [badge](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/courses/09_peer_review/#how-to-evaluate-and-present-the-review-what-are-badges) and complete the review.

## Post-Review Metadata Management

After the review process is completed, the table & metadata owner can move the metadata from draft to one of the 12 other topics with a possible embargo period of 6 months or 1 year.
