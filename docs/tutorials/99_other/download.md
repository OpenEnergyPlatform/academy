You can download any data table on the OEP. Both downloads include the corresponding data table as a csv file.

The datapackage additionally holds the attached metadata as a [json string](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp). It thus provides you with all necessary information as a neat package and we recommend using this. The datapackage is delivered as a .zip file.
