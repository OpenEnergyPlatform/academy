Supplying a license will automate the steps of asking for permission and allowing, so it makes life better for the giving and the receiving end. Note that in some countries, like Germany, it is not possible to waive one's copyright. Data that don't come with any license are not open. A license will provide legal certainty for usage. Choosing an established license will take care of questionable edge cases without umbiguity as well. <br>\n",
