## Introduction

This course will teach you step-by-step how to publish your data and metadata. Comment: Later will be a corresponding course linked here.


## Choosing a table to be published
If you want to publish a table (including [data and] metadata) you have to go to your [profile page](https://openenergyplatform.org/user/profile/959/settings) on the OEP.
Now select the tab [`Tables`](https://openenergyplatform.org/user/profile/959/tables). Listed are data tables that you have uploaded or where you got group permissions assinged to; First are listed all tables you have already published, if you have not published any tables yet, this field will show 'You have never published a table.'.
Beneath are listed all of your tables in the [model draft](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/view/model_draft) section. 
From this tables you can select the table you want to publish. Note: Only tables with an valid id and license in their metadata can be published on the OEP.

## Choosing an embargo and a topic
Once you selected the table you want to publish, a pop-up field `Publish Table` will open. Next to the fields is an `i` icon giving more information if you hover your mouse over it.
First you can apply an embargo; in a drop down menu you can select between none, and a 6 months or 1 year embargo period. 
Note: If you selct `None` there will be no embargo periode applied, even if you selected one while uploading the table.
Second you have to `Select data topic` from one of the 12 available topics; scenario, boundaries, climate, demand, economy, enviromente, grid, openstreetmap, policy, refernce, society and supply.
Note: You can only choose one data topic. With tags it is possible to mark the content of you data even more precisely.

## Finishing the process
Once you click `Confirm` in the pop-up window the table will be moved from the model draft to the data topic you selected. 
Now it can be seen in the [Database](https://openenergyplatform.org/dataedit/schemas) under the selcted topic and on the profile page it is now visible as [Published datatables](https://openenergyplatform.org/user/profile/959/tables).
