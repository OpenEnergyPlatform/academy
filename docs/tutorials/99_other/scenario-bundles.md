## Introduction

This course will teach you step-by-step how to create a scenario bunde. For a more general overview of scenario bundels have a look at the [scneario bundles entry](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/organisation/family_members/templates-and-specification/scenario-bundles/) in the [Open Energy Compendium](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/organisation/).

## Create a new Scenrio Bundle

You can start your [scenario bundle](https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/main) by clicking [+ Create new](https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/id/new). Now you can entry your
- Basic informtation
- Study details (if a study was made/used)
- Publications (more than one can be added with the `+` on the left hand side)
- Sectors and technology (for each (Sector division, Sectors and Technologies) you can choose multiple values)
- Scenarios (more than one can be added with the `+` on the left hand side)
  	- Note that here you can select your input and / or output data used by the scenario and therefore by this scenario bundle. You have to select each table used and / or produced in this scenario by clicking on the `+`. All tables must have been uploaded to the OEP beforehand.
- Models and frameworks (choose all Models and / or Frameworks used for the scenario(s))

All fields have an info symbol next to it where there is an explonation given on how to fill out the field.

After filling out the Acronym under `Basic information` you can save the bundle in the right upper corner. You can always come back and add more information and / or delete the bundle.

## Editing Scenario Bundles

You can find all existing scenario bundles [here](https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/main). You can view Scneario Bundles created by other contributers and view and also edit scenario bundles you created. See also [Scenario Bundles on the OpenEnergyPlatform](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/organisation/family_members/templates-and-specification/scenario-bundles/#scenario-bundles-on-the-openenergyplatform).
