## Introduction

This course will teach you step-by-step how to create a scenario bunde. For a more general overview of scenario bundels have a look at the [scneario bundles entry](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/organisation/family_members/templates-and-specification/scenario-bundles/) in the [Open Energy Compendium](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/organisation/).

## Create a new Scenrio Bundle

You can start your [scenario bundle](https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/main) by clicking [+ Create new](https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/id/new). Now you can entry your
- Basic informtation
- Study details (if a study was made/used)
- Publications (more than one can be added with the `+` on the left hand side)
- Sectors and technology (for each (Sector division, Sectors and Technologies) you can choose multiple values)
- Scenarios
- Models and frameworks (choose all Models and / or Frameworks used for the scenario(s))

After filling out the Acronym under `Basic information` you can save the bundle in the right upper corner. You can always come back and add more information and / or delete the bundle.
