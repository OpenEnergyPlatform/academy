**The users, who have technical experience:**
can connect to the API and use the sandbox for testing the API connection. The sandbox is not visible on the platform. The upload process is very fast, but beware, the sandbox gets deleted regularly. Once accustomed to the sandbox, the user may use the model draft and upload real data within a project.

**The users, who like it easy:**
can use the upload wizard, which is very intuitive and provides good support for all mandatory fields. The data uploaded with the upload wizard will be stored in the model draft. In the model draft, the data is visible, the upload process is fast and the model draft connects to GitHub.
