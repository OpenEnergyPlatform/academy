To upload your data to [open energy database](https://openenergy-platform.org/dataedit/schemas) of the OEP, you will need to have a user account. Here, we show you how to register with the OEP.

You can also go directly to [Register](https://openenergy-platform.org/user/register). Then fill out the required fields and click on _Submit_. You will receive an activation email, sent to your email address. Simply follow the instructions received in the email. After successfully activating and logging into your account, you will see your information as in the screenshot:

## Why and how to register with github?

:oep-icon-info: **Why register with github?**

When you interact with the OEP you also interact with the Open Energy Family (OEF). The development of the OEF and OEP is a community effort that takes place openly at [github](https://www.github.com>) in the github group [Open Energy Platform](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform). There, the various family members of the OEF are developed in different [repositories](<<https://github.com/orgs/OpenEnergyPlatform/repositories>). We welcome you to also participate in their development. To be able to do so, you will thus need to register with github. You can do so at no cost.

:oep-icon-info: **How to register with github and become part of the Open Energy Family team?**

If you do not yet have a github account, you need to [register with github](https://github.com/join). You will then need to become a member of the group [OpenEnergyPlatform](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform) by getting invited to the group. This works as follows: Get in touch via the [OpenEnergy Platform contact form](https://openenergy-platform.org/contact). Fill in the form with your request to be added to the OpenEnergyPlatform group on github. An example text is provided in the screenshot below:

A response will not be immediate. Please wait until you receive an invitation to the github group.
