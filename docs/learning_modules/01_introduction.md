# 01 - Introduction

We have created training courses which provide various material on how to interact with
the OEP. Each training course provides learning materials which cater to different
levels of expertise. Some are targeted at fluent programmers, others are targeted at
persons who prefer to interact with the OEP visually.

You can unfold each of the questions in the green boxes. You will then see a targeted
selection of training materials. Each of these materials is described by a short
abstract that will help you decide whether this is material that will be helpful for
you. If it is, please click the link to view the material.

As a visual guide regarding what to expect behind the links, we use the following icons:

oep-icon::code links to written training material. The material may include some code for guidance.

oep-icon::text links to material focussing on code.

oep-icon::info is some informational text without a link to specific material.

oep-icon::video links to video material.

Our training courses can grow over time. If you see the need for further documentation,
please feel free to get in touch with us via our
