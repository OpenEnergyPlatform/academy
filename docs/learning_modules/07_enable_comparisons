# 06 - Enable good semi-automatic scenario projection comparison - inspriration on how to document your contributed data

This training course provides guidance on how you can document typical data from climate and energy modelling so
that the likelihood of a good semi-automated scenario projection comparison based on the Open Enrgy Knowledgegraph (OEKG) increases. 

## For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, no matter whether you have programming skills or not, who**

- want to publish their data on the OEP
- want that their data enables good quality scenario projection comparisons

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this training course you will**

- be able to document your scenario projection data in a way that helps the OEKG to process semi-automated scenario projection comparisons
