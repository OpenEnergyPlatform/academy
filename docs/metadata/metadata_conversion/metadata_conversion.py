Explanations:
1. The conversion_tools.py file contains all necessary functions to convert metadata from metadata v1.2 to v1.3.
2. For this automation the input file must contain one 'COMMENT ON TABLE' sql-query and NOT more. A prototype input file
is the 'file_in.sql' (metadata version 1.2).
3. The automation can also be adapted to other metadata conversions by changing the json_conversion() function in the
conversion_tools.py file.
