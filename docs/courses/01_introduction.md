# 01 - Introduction

Welcome to the courses section of the Open Energy Academy (OEA). On the OEA, we have created a series of training courses which provide various material on how to interact with [Open Energy Platform](https://openenergyplatform.org). 
The OEP is a web-interface for things related research data management in climate and energy systems modelling. On the OEP, researchers can publish data including FAIR metadata and thus contribute to increasing transparency and interoperability of their research. The functionalities the OEP offers help deliver the [research data management lifecycle](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NFDI4Energy/EFZN_rdm/main/README.md#3). 

To get familiar with research data management in general, we recommend to visit this interactive and comprehensive course [Research Data Management](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NFDI4Energy/EFZN_rdm/main/README.md#1) by University of Oldenburg, Center for Lifelong Learning, Digitalisierte Energiesysteme, funded by Energie-Forschungszentrum Niedersachsen and supported by nfdi4energy and Zentrum f√ºr digitale Innovationen Niedersachsen. 

Each of the training courses here on the OEA provide targeted at working with the Open Energy Platform and its tools. The courses contain written content and / or links to learning materials which cater to different levels of expertise. Some materials are targeted at fluent programmers, others are targeted at persons who prefer to interact with the OEP visually.
As a visual guide regarding what to expect behind links you may find in a training couse, we use the following icons:

:oep-icon-code: links to written training material. The material may include some code for guidance.

:oep-icon-text: links to material focussing on code.

:oep-icon-info: is some informational text without a link to specific material.

:oep-icon-video: links to video material.

Our training courses will grow over time. If you see the need for further topics that you see the need for documentation, please feel free to get in touch with us via our [contact form](https://openenergyplatform.org/contact/).
