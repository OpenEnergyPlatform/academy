# 01 - Introduction

Welcome to the courses section of the Open Energy Academy (OEA). On the OEA, we have created a series of training courses which provide various material on how to interact with OEP. Each of our training courses provides targeted content directly within the course and / or links to learning materials which cater to different levels of expertise. Some materials are targeted at fluent programmers, others are targeted at persons who prefer to interact with the OEP visually.
As a visual guide regarding what to expect behind links you may find in a training couse, we use the following icons:

:oep-icon-code: links to written training material. The material may include some code for guidance.

:oep-icon-text: links to material focussing on code.

:oep-icon-info: is some informational text without a link to specific material.

:oep-icon-video: links to video material.

Our training courses will grow over time. If you see the need for further topics that you see the need for documentation, please feel free to get in touch with us via our [contact form](https://openenergyplatform.org/contact/).
