## For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, policy makers and any interested person, who**

- wants to find and view data on the OEP
- wants to find and download data on the OEP
- wants to find out which data belongs to which scenarios

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this training course you will**

- be able to find data on the OEP via the data search functionality
- be able to download data tables as .csv or as a datapackage including the metadata
- be able to use the REST-full-HTTP API in Python for selecting and downloading data from the OEP 
- be able to use the oeclient with Python or the command line to select and download data from the OEP
- know that you can check the scenario bundles on the OEP to learnm ore about scenarios, the corresponding data and context

## How can I find relevant information on the OEP?

:oep-icon-text: [How to find data on the OEP?](../tutorials/99_other/find_data.md) (tutorial):
This tutorial teaches you how to use the free text search and tags to filter for data on the OEP. You will see that you can use both approaches individually, but also combine freetext and tags to specify your data filter further.

## How can I download / interact with data on the OEP?

:oep-icon-text: [How to download data - CSV and data package](../tutorials/99_other/download.md) (tutorial):
Learn how easy it is to download any data table you are viewing on the OEP table with only one click and why a data package makes a difference.

:oep-icon-code: [Data queries via API](../tutorials/01_api/01_api_download.ipynb) (tutorial):
This tutorial provides an overview of how you can select, filter and download data that resides on the OEP via the REST-full-HTTP
API in Python

:oep-icon-code: [Data queries with the oeclient via Python ](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/tutorials/02_oep_client/01_client_python_download/) (tutorial):
The oeclient is another way on how you can download data from the OEP. This turorial teaches you how to do so using a python script. 

:oep-icon-code: [Data queries with the oeclient via command line](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/academy/tutorials/02_oep_client/03_client_cli_download/) (tutorial):
If you prefer command line over python, we have you covered: please check this turorial for learning how to use the oeclient on the command line to download data from the OEP.



## How can I find relevant information about scenarios on the OEP?

:oep-icon-info: Our [scenario bundles](https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/main) provide dedicated information about scenarios and their context. Context for example includes the study reports that deal with the scenario(s), the projection data available on the OEP that were created using the scenario(s), the sectors and technologies depicted and so on. These bundles are based on (Resource Description Framework) RDF and the Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG) and they are tied to the [Open Energy Ontology](https://openenergyplatform.org/ontology/) (OEO) for improving comparability across scenario bundles.
