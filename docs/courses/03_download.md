# 03 - Download - Find and download / interact with data

Learn to find and download [data](https://openenergy-platform.org/dataedit/schemas) on the OEP.

## For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, policy makers and any interested person, who**

- wants to find and view data on the OEP
- wants to find and download data on the OEP

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this training course you will**

- be able to find data on the OEP via the data search functionality
- be able to download data tables as .csv or as a datapackage including the metadata
- be able to select and filter data that resides on the OEP via the REST-full-HTTP API in Python
- be able to use the REST-full-HTTP API in Python for selecting data on the OEP, make calculations with it and save the results to a file

## How can I find relevant information on the OEP?

:oep-icon-text: [How to find data on the OEP?](../tutorials/search/18_find_data.md) (tutorial):

This tutorial teaches you how to use the free text search and tags to filter for data on the OEP. You will see that you can use both approaches individually, but also combine freetext and tags to specify your data filter further.

## How can I download data?

:oep-icon-code: [Process query result data and save to file (tutorial)](../tutorials/api/OEP_API_tutorial_part4.ipynb):

Learn how to use the REST-full-HTTP API in Python for selecting data on the OEP, make calculations
with it and save the results to a file.

:oep-icon-text: [How to download data - CSV and data package (tutorial)](../tutorials/download/19_download.md):

Learn how easy it is do download any data table you are viewing on the OEP table with only one click and why a data package makes a difference.

## How can I interact with data?

:oep-icon-code: [Data queries via API (tutorial)](../tutorials/api/OEP_API_tutorial_part2.ipynb):

This tutorial provides an overview of how you can select and filter data that resides on the OEP via the REST-full-HTTP
API in Python

:oep-icon-code: [Process query result data and save to file (tutorial)](../tutorials/api/OEP_API_tutorial_part4.ipynb):

Learn how to use the REST-full-HTTP API in Python for selecting data on the OEP, make calculations
with it and save the results to a file.

## How can I find relevant information about scenarios on the OEP?

:oep-icon-info: Our current [scenario factsheets](https://openenergy-platform.org/factsheets/scenarios/) provide some dedicated information about specific scenarios for which projection data is available on the OEP. Please note, however, that their format was developed some time ago and they will undergo substantial updates. In the future, these scenario factsheets will be succeeded by [study factsheets (alpha)](https://openenergy-platform.org/factsheets/rdf/study/) that will hold more functionality. These improved factsheets will be based on RDF and the Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG) which is currently under heavy development. Please note that this is therefore just a preview and not a fully functional feature yet.
