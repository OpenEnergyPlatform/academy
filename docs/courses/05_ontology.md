# 05 - Ontology

## Part 1 - How to become an OEO developer

### For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at (energy system) researchers who**

- want to understand the OEO design choices,
- want to get to know the OEO development processes,
- want to participate in ontology development and
- want to collaborate developping a powerful open-source tool to enhance data management in the energy domain under the FAIR principles.

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this module, you will know**

- which skills are needed for OEO development,
- how the OEO development process works and
- how to participate in OEO development.

### What are prerequisit skills for ontology development?

OEO development requires some skills which will help you understand the OEO better and enable you to participate in the ontology development.
These are:

1. BFO basics
2. Protégé and OWL basics
3. GitHub and git
4. OEO specific knowledge

#### 1. BFO basics

OEO uses the formal structure and design principles of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).
The more you are familiar with BFO, the better you can contribute to the development process.

:oep-icon-video: For a quick overview on BFO, this video tutorial gives an introduction.
[Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joC4NZgLtqA)

:oep-icon-text: The standard literature on BFO is [_Arp, Smith and Spear (2015): Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology_](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4044/Building-Ontologies-with-Basic-Formal-Ontology). If you decide to become an OEO developer, you should read this book. It is also helpfull if you want to look up stuff at a later state.

Please also checkout [BFO on github](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO). In the [BFO github wiki](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/wiki) you can find some more other publications and information on BFO.

#### 2. Protégé and OWL basics

OEO is based on the Web Ontology Language OWL and uses Manchester Syntax. Protégé is the tool that we are using for OEO development.
:oep-icon-text: To become familiar with Protégé and OWL, we recommend to study the [Pizza tutorial](https://www.michaeldebellis.com/post/new-protege-pizza-tutorial) by Micheal DeBellis, especially chapter 1 to 7.
For the tutorial, and the OEO development later, you have to install Protégé on your computer.

You can find the OWL2 and Manchester Syntax documentation [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/) for further reading.

#### 3. GitHub and git basics

The documentations of the OEO development, its discussion and version control all take place on GitHub. Therefore, it is necesarry to familiarize with the GitHub platform and the version control software [git](https://git-scm.com/).

- GitHub provides a helpful guide for the [first steps with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account).
- There, you can also learn, how to [set up git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
- An introductory tutorial on how to use git you can find [here](https://githowto.com/).

### Which OEO specific knowledge do I need?

We published an introductory paper about the OEO in 2021 in the journal Energy and AI. It gives you a good overview over the domain, the structure and the workflow of OEO development.

:oep-icon-text: [Introducing the Open Energy Ontology: Enhancing data interpretation and interfacing in energy systems analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546821000288)

The OEO wiki provides you details on how best practice principles of ontology development are applied to OEO development: https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/wiki/Best-Practice-Principles

Since energy is a complex physical phenomenon and challenging to describe ontologically, we published another OEO specific paper that describes, how we decided to represent energy and energy carriers in the OEO.

fuels in the Open Energy Ontology](http://star.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-3249/paper1-Ensusto.pdf)

### I have read everything - how can I join the developer team now?

1. Get in touch with us!
2. We always welcome new members to the development team in our regular oeo-dev-meetings, where organizational stuff and content related issues are discussed.
3. To participate in the OEO development process on GitHub, you need to be part of the [OpenEnergyFamily organization](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform).
4. Afterwards, you can follow all instructions and explainations of the general workflow in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.
