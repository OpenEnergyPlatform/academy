# 10 - What is a scenario bundle on the Open Energy Platform and how to create one 
THIS COURSE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, no matter whether you have programming skills or not, who want**

- to enhance quantitative data on the OEP by context information that goes beyond the pure metadata annotation. 

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this training course you will**

- be able to create a scenario bundle that describes context of data you have published on the OEP

## What is a scenario bundle?

Scenario bundles weave together important information about one or more scenarios. They inform about studies made based on a [scenario](https://openenergyplatform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000364/), including publications (= [study report](https://openenergyplatform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00020012/)).

If there is quantitative input data and / or output data available for a [scenario projection](https://openenergyplatform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00010262/), scenario bundles provide direct links to that data. 
Scenario bundles  also inform about models (if available as a model factsheet) and frameworks (if available as a framework factsheet) that were used to project a scenario into the future.
                                                                                                                                        
In a nutshell: A scenario bundle provides you with all relevant information to understand a scenario's context and to ease a potential re-use of quantitative data for your own purposes.

## How to create a scenario bundle
* Navigate to: https://openenergyplatform.org/scenario-bundles/main
* Click the **+Create** button 
* Now you will presented with various areas that you can populate with information about your scenario.

**Note: if you are presented with a drop-down menu in the following forms, you will see already existing entries that may fit what you want to add. Then simply choose this information. If the information (e.g. an author) is not yet available from a drop-down menu, simply start typing what you would want to enter and your information will be added to the open energy knowledge graph that works in the background. Some drop-down menus (e.g. scenario years) have fixed entries and you won't be able to add your own information**



* **Basic information**:  Start with filling in the basic information. Scenario bundles are meant to describe scenarios that were part of a study (i.e. a project). Thus, please provide the study name, an acronym and the institutions that were involved int the study/project.

* **Study detail**: The study detail area helps you describe more context about the study. Please provide the funding sources, a short abstract to describe the purpose of the study. If you do find one or more fitting study descriptors, please select which ones apply to your study.

* **Publications**: This area gives you room to provide all publications that were made based on the scenarios you describe. You can add more than one study by clicking the **+** button on the left.
