# 02 - What is a scenario bundle and how to create one 
THIS COURSE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## For whom is this trainin and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, no matter whether you have programming skills or not, who want**

- to enhance quantitative data on the OEP by context information that goes beyond the pure metadata annotation. 

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this training course you will**

- be able to create a scenario bundle that describes context of data you have published on the OEP

## What is a scenario bundle?

Scenario bundles weave together important information about one or more scenarios. They inform about studies made based on a scenario, including publications (= study report).

If there is quantitative input data and / or output data available on the OEP, scenario bundles provide direct links to that data. 
Scenario bundles  also inform about models (if available as a model factsheet) and frameworks (if available as a framework factsheet) that were used to project a scenario into the future (= scenario projection).

In a nutshell: A scenario bundle provides you with all relevant information to understand a scenario's context and to ease a potential re-use of quantitative data for your own purposes.
