!!! note

    The Open Peer Review on the OEP is currently under development!

## For whom is this training and what can you learn?

:oep-icon-info: **This course is aimed at researchers, who**

- publish data and seek a quality check for the metadata to ensure accuracy and completeness
- want to review and enhance an existing dataset, ensuring its reliability, relevance, and usability

:oep-icon-info: **After reading the sections of this training course you will**

- understand the developed open peer review for open data
- be able to start and complete an open peer review on the OEP
- contribute to and improve the implemented review process

## Introduction: What is Open Peer Review?

In the realm of open science, Open Peer Review (OPR) is gaining increasing
significance as an alternative approach to evaluating scholarly works.
Unlike traditional peer review processes, which often lack transparency
and clear criteria, OPR distinguishes itself through specific characteristics.
This chapter delves into the features and benefits of OPR, focusing on the
criticisms of conventional peer reviews and highlighting the importance of
transparency, open participation, and identifiable contributors in the
evaluation process.
Additionally, we explore how OPR facilitates broader involvement from experts
and interest groups, leading to improved quality and validation of research findings.

[Ross-Hellauer's 2017 study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189311) identified four key features that differentiate
an open peer review from conventional peer review.

### Open Identities

Open Peer Review (OPR) adopts an _unblinded review_ approach, where in contrast
to traditional peer review processes, both reviewers and authors
are openly acknowledged and documented.
In a _single-blind review_, the identities of the reviewers are known to the
authors (or contributors), while the authors' identities remain concealed.
This aims to mitigate biases that could arise from authors' reputations or
affiliations.
A downside is the lack of incentive for the extra work and time.
In contrast, the open identities in OPR serve as a motivating factor for
conducting accurate work and ensure visibility of contributions within the community.

### Open Reports

Open reports entail the inclusion of the reviewer's report along with their name.
This introduces transparency to what was previously an opaque and boolean process.
Like open identities, this heightened transparency is anticipated to enhance
the quality of reviews, as the report becomes accessible to the public.
It serves as an additional incentive or reward for reviewers.

### Open Participation

Open participation expands the review process beyond a single person or a small
group of experts to include a larger community or group.
While traditional peer review often involves inviting a select few individuals
to participate, open participation allows interested parties to provide
structured feedback or comments.
By increasing the number of reviewers, the dominance of individual interests
can be avoided.
Embracing multiple perspectives and diverse knowledge enhances the accuracy
of the review, which may be lacking when conducted by an individual alone.
Additionally, previously overlooked groups have the opportunity to contribute
to the process.
Therefore, not only selected individuals from academia, but also groups
from industry or members of interest groups can actively participate.

### Open Platforms

Open Platforms play a crucial role in facilitating the implementation of
open peer review and fostering collaboration within the scholarly community.
It is a digital space where researchers can engage in transparent and
interactive review processes.
Needed functionalities are data or document sharing, version control,
commenting, and collaborative editing, enabling reviewers and authors to
exchange feedback and ideas seamlessly.
The platform needs to incorporate features that support
open identities, open reports, and open participation, ensuring a transparent
and inclusive environment for the review process.

The Open Energy Platform (OEP) serves as a community platform for conducting
Open Peer Review (OPR) in the field of energy research.
It provides a robust infrastructure that enables researchers to openly
share and review energy-related datasets, methodologies, and findings.
With its features designed for transparency, collaboration,
and open participation, the OEP empowers the energy research community
to engage in rigorous and inclusive peer review, driving the advancement
of knowledge and fostering innovation in the field of energy.

## How do you review open data?

:oep-icon-code: [Tutorial on Open Peer Review] (link to tutorial once its published) 
This tutorial gives a detailed step by step description of the Open Peer Review Process on the OEP.

Adapting an open peer review process to open data and its metadata
involves a structured approach to ensure the quality and reliability
of the information.
The current development on the OEP provides the functionality to review
and comment on every metadata key of the published data.
The reviewer can either _Accept_, _Suggest_, or _Deny_ an entry and can
provide a value suggestion and a comment.
The review is structured after the main sections of the Open Energy Metadata
standard.
It offers a progress indicator and a summary page.

## How to evaluate and present the review? What are badges?

Based on a scientific survey, the individual metadata keys were evaluated and
categorized into groups. By accepting all entries in this section,
a corresponding badge is awarded. These badges are named after precious metals
such as "iron," "bronze," "silver," "gold," and "platinum."

- **Iron** – Technically required for data structure
- **Bronze** – Basic description of the data
- **Silver** – Supplement description of the data
- **Gold** – Extended description of the context
- **Platinum** – Ontological annotation

## Who is involved in a review?

### Data Contributor

The original creator of a table has all permissions and is the owner.

### Reviewer

Every registered member of the OEP can start a OPR of every table.
You cannot start the review of the tables if you are the owner.

### Editor / Community Manager

The editor asks members to start and submit a review for specific tables.
When a review started and is not completed the editor can close the review to proceed.
In case the contributor and reviewer do not come to an agreement, the editor decides.
The editor is not implemented yet.
